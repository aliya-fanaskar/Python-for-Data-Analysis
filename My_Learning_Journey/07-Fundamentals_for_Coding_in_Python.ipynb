    "### OOP Key Concepts in Python\n",
    "Python supports the core principles of object-oriented programming, which are the building blocks for designing robust and reusable software. These are:\n",
    "#### → Object\n",
    "An object represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data. It is an instance of a class.\\\n",
    "An object consists of:\n",
    "- State : It is represented by the attributes and reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "- Behaviour : It is represented by the methods of an object and reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "- Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### → Class\n",
    "A class is a collection of objects. It defines a set of rules, attributes(state of the object) and methods (a consequential logic unit that can be applied to the object) that the created objects (instances) can have. These attributes are variables that belong to a class and are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.\\\n",
    "They are blueprints for creating objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### → Encapsulation\n",
    "Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### → Inheritance\n",
    "One class can inherit properties / methods from another class. It supports hierarchical classification and promotes code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### → Polymorphism\n",
    "Same method behaves differently depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### → Abstraction\n",
    "Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features."
